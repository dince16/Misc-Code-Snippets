#### [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)
#### Finding the Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays  
Description: Find the intersection of two sorted integer arrays.
Example: [1,3,6,17,21], [2,4,6,21] # returns (6, 21)
#### Least Common Ancestor
Part 1: Given one root node and two arbitrary nodes (node1 and node2) in a binary tree, return the Lowest Common Ancestor of those two nodes.
Part 2: Given two arbitrary nodes (node1 and node2; no root node) in a binary tree, return the Lowest Common Ancestor of those two nodes
Part 3: Can you complete Part 2 in constant space?
Part 4: Imagine exactly the same setup as before, except that there happens to be an infinite* number of nodes in the tree, meaning you can never reach the root node (or a leaf node) from a given node (in theory). Can you still find the LCA of two arbitrary nodes?
